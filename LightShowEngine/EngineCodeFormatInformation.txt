The code in this engine has been created using the following guidelines^1.

1. Proper indenting. Statements inside of an if,for,while,function,method,class,struct, or other, are indented accordingly.

2. Horizontal spacing. an example of this : when passing arguements into a function, there is going to be generally one space after each comment.

3. Vertical spacing. Generally after each statement, there is one vertical space.

4. No long lines. Anything over 120 characters long is generally seperated into two or more lines after each comma, parenthesi, or other, and then treated with indentation like an if statement.

5. Comments. the comments in this code should be placed when needed. They should not explain the obvoius, but they should provide well documentation on what is going on. 

5 A. Comments above Structs, functions, classes and other will describe in detail what the function/class/struct/other is used for, and how to use it.

5 B. Comments will generally be placed on the same line as a statement, and above functions, classes, structs or other. 

5 C. The comments also use indentation to keep a neat seperated look between the code and comments.

6. Use reference instead of pointer if possible, it tells me (or anyone else reading the code) that the variable will never be null. (or function will never return null)


^1. These are all guidelines, these are not rules set in stone, they can and will be modified if need be, but it is wise to generally follow them.
